#### Sizing

height : px
fonts : px

The size of images are set in index.html as recommended by W3C as in: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_img_width.asp

Margin and padding are sized in pixels for having the same size on differents devices.

Fonts are sized in pixels rather than in em/rem for being the closest possible to the PNG model.

Width are sized in % for being responsive at any viewport width.
